## OneLake

***OneLake*** is a single, unified *data lake* for the whole organization.
It hosts only **one copy of data** for the entire organization to use in multiple analytica engines.[^1]

OneLake is built on top of the *Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen 2* and can support any type of file (structured or unstructured).
All items are stored in the **Delta Parquet format** (columnar).
It is also possible to create *shortcuts* for copying data from different locations (data stays in the original source).

it is possible to use different *engines* to connect to data, using different languages (e.g. T-SQL, Python) and tools/services (e.g. Pipelines, Notebooks):

- **T-SQL** (Warehousing)
- **Spark** (Synapse Data Engineering & Data Science)
- **Analysis Services** (for Power BI)
- **KQL** (real-time analytics).

Moreover, Microsoft Fabric can be integrated with **Git (Azure DevOps)** to manage Deployment Pipelines and *versioning*.
Finally, it is possible to use ***Microsoft Purview*** to have details on Fabric Workspaces and data.
In Fabric, it is possible to use ***Data Activator*** to set up alerts (e.g. from Power BI reports).

Each process in Fabric (e.g. refreshes, notebooks, pipelines) can be monitored in the ***Monitoring Hub***.
There is also an app called *Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics* ([link to the app](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/power-bi/pbi_pcmm.microsoftpremiumfabricpreviewreport?tab=Overview)) to monitor resources usage across the Tenant (only for Admins).
