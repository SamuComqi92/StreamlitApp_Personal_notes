**Microsoft Fabric** is *web-based platform all-in-one solution* to work with data, from the ingestion to the data trasformation and the final visualization and delivery. 
It offers the possibility to see and work with every aspect of data, including the possibility to implement Machine Learning models.

These notes have been collected after following the Microsoft eLearning materials and while exploring the main *Fabric* features using a *Trial licence*. Of course, they may be corrected and/or updated following the Microsoft Fabric changes.
