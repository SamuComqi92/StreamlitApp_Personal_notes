### Hybrid Transactional / Analytical Processing (HTAP)

It is a type of data processing that combines *transactional data* and *analytical data* processings.

In general, those two processings are separate in OLTP and OLAP. Given that they are separated, there is a **delay**: this delay is smaller with **HTAP**. It can be considered as a *rela-time analytics on OLTP data*.

Basically, a copy of data is created automatically in an analytical store (with no impact on the source DB) with low-latency.

In Azure Synapse Analytics, HTAP solutions are supported by *Azure Synapse Link* that is a general term for a set of *linked services* like:
- Dataverse (to an Azure DataLake)
- Cosmo DB (to workspace)
- SQL DB (dedicated pool - Server, Azure).

Once a link is created, it is possible to read data but also to write new data (for example, using *notebooks* or *Synapse SQL*).
