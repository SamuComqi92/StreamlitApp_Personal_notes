### Create a Lake Database

It is possible to create a *Lakehouse* to store data and use the advantages of structured schemas.

It is possible to use *templates* and define *relationships* using keys. A Lakehouse can be created with *Azure Synapse Analytics* with a graphical interface.

In a Lakehouse, it is possible to work with data in a:
- Serverless SQL pool.
- Apache Spark pool (using SQL API).

A *database* can be created using the ***designer*** in *Apache Syanapse studio*: it is a drag&drop process to create and edit tables, columns, and relationships (also from files).
- **Using a Serverless SQL pool**. To use a database:

```sql
CREATE name_db
GO
```

- **Apache Spark Pool (Notebook)**. Using a *magic* command:

```sql
%%sql
SELECT * FROM name_db.schema.table ...
```
