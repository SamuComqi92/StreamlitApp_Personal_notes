### Azure Synapse Analytics

Service for *analytic tasks* in a web-based portal (**Synapse Studio**). This service can be easily integrated with other services.

Synapse makes available notebooks and *Apache Spark* for big data processing. Data is managed in *Workspaces*.

Data i stored in a *DataLake* (ADLS Gen 2) and it can be:
- processed through **pipelines** (as in *Data Factory*).
- queried using *SQL*.

SQL can be used in two *pools*:
1. *Serverless pool* (for Datalake).
2. *Dedicated pool* (for data Warehouse).

.

**Serverless Pool**

It used for querying data *on-demand* in a Datalake, using **T-SQL**. This pool is used for:
- Data Exploration
- Data Transformation
- Creating a *logical Data Warehouse* (store in the Lake).

In this context, a veru useful function is **OPENROWSET** to work with files:

```sql
OPENROWSET(BULK = 'link', FORMAT = 'csv', FIRSTROW = 2, ...)
```

The first argument "*BULK*" will contain the link to files:
- ***file_name.csv***: for one specific file.
- ***file*.csv***: starting with 'file'.
- *: all files in the folder.
- **: all files in the folder and subfolders.

The "*FIRSTROW = 2*" is used to skop file headers. With *OPENROWSET* it is possible to define columns:

```sql
OPENROWSET(...) WITH (col1 INT, col2 INT, ...) AS ROWS
```

For JSON files, values can be retrieved using the *JSON_VALUE* function along with *(ALIAS, '$.key')*.

.

**Create objects**

It is possible to create *databases*, *data sources*, *files*, and *tables* using the **T-SQL** syntax:
```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE name AS SELECT (...OPENROWSET...)
``` 
to store the result of a query in a table in a serverless/dedicated pool. After *EXTERNAL TABLE*, it is possible to use *WITH* to define location, data source, format, etc.

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE name 
WITH(
  LOCATION = 'link/to/location/'
  ...
)
```

to create a data source in a database.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE name @param INT
AS BEGIN
  ...
END
```

to create a stored-procedure for data transformation, table creation and more.

***Synapse Authentication***: it is possible to use SQL (only for *pools*) or *Azure Active Directory (AAD)* (also for other services).
