1. *Ingest*: to acquire source data and store raw data into data lake.
2. *Store*: where to store data (e.g. Azure DataLake Storage Gen 2).
3. *Preparation & Training*: data preparation & Machine Learning training (e.g. Synapse, ML Studio).
4. *Model & Serve*: to present data to users (e.g. Synapse, Power BI).
