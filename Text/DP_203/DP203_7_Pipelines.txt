### Pipelines in Azure Synapse Analytics

Pipelines are systems to apply ETL processes on data. They are made of **Activities**, i.e. executable tasks connected in a *flow* with one or more branches (also depending on the success/failure of activities).

Some tasks are:
- Extraction: of data from a source.
- Integration: of data to a target.
- ETL processese.
- Notebooks: using Spark
- Control flow activities: loops, parameters, values, etc.

To work with data, it is necesary to define **linked services** to access external sources and bring data in the pipeline.

.

A pipeline can be created in *Azure Synapse Studio* using the *graphical design interface* (drop & drop). Activities can be connected if **succeeded**, **failed**, or **completed**.

A pipeline can be modified/updated from its JSON file where all activities and connections are defined with their properties.

.

In a pipeline, it is possible to add **dataflows** (sources > transformations > target) that can be created in a separated window.

Pipelines can be executed:
- Immediately (on demand).
- Scheduled.
- In response to events.
