### Introduction

***Data Engineering* for analytics solutions:

- *Data Integration*: establishing *links* between services and data sources across multiple systems.
- *Transforming data*: through ETLs and ELTs for analysis.
- *Consolidating data*: to combine different data into a *consistent structure* for analysis and reporting.

Data is pulled from structured and unstructured sources and there are several languages to use in **Notebooks**:
- SQL
- Python
- Others (R, Scala, ...)

.

**Import Data Engineering concepts**

- *Operational & Analytical data*: *operational* data corresponds to transactional data, store in (non-)relational databases. *Analytical* data has been optimized for analysis and reporting (e.g. data warehouse).
- *Streaming data*: refers to sources & real-time data (e.g. IoT devices).
- *Data Pipeline*: to implement ETL/ELT activities.
- *Data Lake*: large repository of **raw data** from multiple sources.
- *Data Warehouse*: repository of *integrated data* (historical data) with optimized schema (for fat reading and analysis).
- *Apache Spark*: open-source tool for *big data processing*.
