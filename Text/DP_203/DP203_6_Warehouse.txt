### Relational Data Warehouse

A *relational data Warehouse* can be created in a *dedicated SQL pool* in Azure Synapse Analytics. A data warehouse is made of **dimension tables** and **fact tables** connected through relationships in a *star schema* or a *snowflake schema*.

Before creating a warehouse, it is necessary to create a *dedicated SQL pool* (going to "Manage" in Synapse).

Tables can be created using the commands **CREATE TABLE** or **CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE** specifying name, columns, datatype, etc. Along with dimensions and fact tables, there can be the so-called **staging tables** that play a role in the *loading process* of data from different sources.

Once tables are created, it is necessary to *load the data* inside them, and it is possible to use:

```sql
COPY INTO name FROM source_table
```

where the *source_table* is added with a link to the Lakehouse. In generale the process is the following:
1. Datalake: pre-cleaning and tranformations
2. Staging: updating rows or generating new ones
3. Final tables: dimensions and facts usins ghe COPY INTO command from staing (supporting CRUD operations).

Instead of using the *COPY INTO* command, it is possible to use **INSERT INTO** or **CREATE TABLE name AS SELECT ... FROM source_table** (*CTAS*).
