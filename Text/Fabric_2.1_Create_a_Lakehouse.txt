##### 2.1 Create a Lakehouse

First, to create a Lakehouse, one must have a **Premium/Fabric Workspace**.
Once created, on the bottom left, there is an icon to switch between the different services providede by Microsoft Fabric.
In this case, "***Data Engineering***" is the appropriate one to create a new Lakehouse.

Once in the main hub, click on "*New Lakehouse*" (on the top left) and choose a name for the Lakehouse (only alphanumeric characters and underscores).
Once a Lakehouse has been created, a message will appear on top, saying that along with the Lakehouse, a *semantic model* and a "SQL Endpoint" have been created in the relative Workspace.[^1]

The main hub will display a list of objects in two *main folders*: the ***Tables*** folder and the ***Files*** folder:

- ***Tables***: use T-SQL to analyze data organized in *Delta tables*.[^2]
- ***Files***: for files like *.csv*, *.xlsx*, etc. To see data, select the appropriate folder and navigate the list by clikcing on the three dots next to the folder name. Moreover, it is possible to create *sub-folders* by clicking on the three dots.
- Both in Tables and Files, it is possible to create *sub-folders* and *shortcuts* i.e. objects on OneLake that point to other storage location, like a sort of *link* towards OneLake, ADLS Gen 2, Amazon S3 or Dataverse).[^3]

[^1] Note: once a table is created, it is automatically added to the default semantic model. This can be disabled in the *Lakehouse settings*.

[^2] Delta Tables are in *Parquet format*, labelled with a small black delta symbol.

[^3] Shortcuts can be created by Workspace admins, members, and contributors. All of them must have write/read permission on shortcuts in the source locations. Viewers can only read data in shortcuts. In general if a shortcut is deleted, data is not deleted in the source location.
