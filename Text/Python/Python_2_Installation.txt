### Installation & Execution

Python is available on a variety of platforms (e.g., Windows, Linux, Max, etc.). For the installation, it is possible to find the appropriate *.exe* file (or procedure) for a specific system on the official website:

[https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

.

On *Windows*, it is only necessary to run the executable file to install it.[^1] Once installed, it is ready to use. In the command prompt:
- Write *python* to use it.
- Write *exit()* to close it.


[^1]: For the other systems, see the appropriate documentation for the installation.
