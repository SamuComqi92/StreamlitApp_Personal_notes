### Installation & Execution

Python is available on a variety of platforms (e.g., Windows, Linux, Max, etc.). For the installation, it is possible to find the appropriate *.exe* file (or procedure) for a specific system on the official website:

[https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

On *Windows*, it is only necessary to run the executable file to install it.[^1] Once installed, it is ready to use. In the command prompt:
- Write *python* to use it.
- Write *exit()* to close it.

.

When a Python script is created, it can be saved in a file with a ***.py*** extension. The file can be further modified, or it can be executed directly from the command prompt. 

To execute the file, it is necessary to go to the same directory of the *.py* script and write ***python file_with_script.py*** to display the result in the prompt.

.

To write Python scripts in an interactive and colored version, it is possible to use **Visual Studio Code**, a Microsoft source-code editor. 

All the necessary information regarding installation and usage can be found on the official website, including the *Python* extension:

The interactive version of Python is provided by **Jupyter Notebooks** which can be used to write and execute portions of code while displaying the results.
