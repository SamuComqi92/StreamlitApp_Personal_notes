### 2.1 Create a Lakehouse

First, to create a Lakehouse, one must have a **Premium/Fabric Workspace**.
Once created, on the bottom left, there is an icon to switch between the different services providede by Microsoft Fabric.
In this case, "***Data Engineering***" is the appropriate one to create a new Lakehouse.

Once in the main hub, click on "*New Lakehouse*" (on the top left) and choose a name for the Lakehouse (only alphanumeric characters and underscores).
Once a Lakehouse has been created, a message will appear on top, saying that along with the Lakehouse, a *semantic model* and a "SQL Endpoint" have been created in the relative Workspace.[^1]

The main hub will display a list of objects in two *main folders*: the ***Tables*** folder and the ***Files*** folder:

- ***Tables***: use T-SQL to analyze data organized in *Delta tables*.[^2]
- ***Files***: for files like *.csv*, *.xlsx*, etc. To see data, select the appropriate folder and navigate the list by clikcing on the three dots next to the folder name. Moreover, it is possible to create *sub-folders* by clicking on the three dots.
- Both in Tables and Files, it is possible to create *sub-folders* and *shortcuts* i.e. objects on OneLake that point to other storage location, like a sort of *link* towards OneLake, ADLS Gen 2, Amazon S3 or Dataverse).[^3]

Delta tables are part of the ***Delta Lake***, an open-source relational storage method for Spark to support *Parquet-format tables* (it uses the relational database semantics on Spark processes). This format supports *CRUD operations*, *ACID properties*, and *data versioning* (the so-called **time-travel**), and it is possible to read it in a faster way compared to other formats. It is possible to create Delta tables using *Notebooks* (see next).

In the Lakehouse main hub, the main buttons are:

- Refresh button (also for the *Tables* and "Files" folders).
- "*Get Data*" section to connect to different data sources.
- "*New Power BI semantic model*", to create a new model with specific tables. Tables inside the model are connected
 to the OneLake with the so-called ***DirectLake connection***.
"*Open Notebook*" (a new or an existing one).

A file/folder in *Files* can be uploaded by clicking on the three dots next to the *Files* folder name and then "*Upload a file/folder*". A file in a folder cna be **loaded as a table** (Delta format) by clicking on the three dots next to its name and then "*Load to Tables*". At this point:

- The file will be in the *Tables* folder (not in the *Files* folder anymore).
- It will be possible to expand the list of columns.
- It will be possible to see a preview of the data.
- In "View Files", it will be possible to see the created files, i.e., the Parquet files and the JSON *_delta_log* file containing the modifictions log.

Using Lakehouses (or even Warehouses - see next), it is possible to implement the ***Medallion architecture*** within Fabric to mange each data level (i.e. *bronze, silver, gold*). Microsoft suggests two patterns:

1. Create a Lakehouse for each data level;
2. Create a Lakehouse for bronze and silver layers, a *Warehouse* for the gold level.

Moreover, Microsoft suggests to create a separate Workspace for each Lakehouse/Warehouse location and use Delta tables for silver and gold levels to enhance the overall performance.



[^1]: Note: once a table is created, it is automatically added to the default semantic model. This can be disabled in the *Lakehouse settings*.

[^2]: Delta Tables are in *Parquet format*, labelled with a small black delta symbol.

[^3]: Shortcuts can be created by Workspace admins, members, and contributors. All of them must have write/read permission on shortcuts in the source locations. Viewers can only read data in shortcuts. In general if a shortcut is deleted, data is not deleted in the source location.
