### 2.2.7 Data Wrangler

In a notebook, it is possible to use the so-called ***Data Wrangler*** with *Pandas dataframes*. 
Once a *Pandas dataframe* has been defined in the notebook, from the top menu, click on “*Data*” and then “**Data Wrangler**”:
a small window will appear telling you to choose an existing dataframe (created inside the Notebook). 
Once chosen, the dataframe can be modified in the *Data Wrangler window*.

The *Data Wrangler* is like Power Query Editor: 
data is shown with statistics, and columns can be modified using the menu on the left. 
Once a transformation has been chosen, it is possible to “Apply” it, generating a new piece of code. 
This code can be saved directly into the new Notebook as a new step.
