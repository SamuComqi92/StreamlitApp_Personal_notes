### 3.3 Delete Data activity

One of the most used activities is the ***Delete Data*** Activity. 
This activity can be used to remove old files from the *Files* folder when a *Copy Data* activity is in the pipeline (and/or when data are modified using a **Notebook**).

Using the top menu, it is possible to add the activity in the pipeline. After that it is possible to:
-	Define its name.
-	Define the folder where files must be removed. The removal can be done by:
  -	Specifying a file name (with “*File path*”).
  -	Specifying a file list (with “*List of files*”).
  - Specifying files based on a rule (with “*Wildcard file path*” - for example, use “*.csv” to remove all *.csv* files).

One note to keep in mind: 
if two activities are connected to another one, this latter will be executed only when **both** the previous activities are successful (it is a logical *AND* between events).
