### 3.1 Create a Pipeline

To create a Pipeline, in the Data Factory hub (section “*New*”), click on “*Data pipeline*” and choose a name. 
Once the pipeline has been created, it will be saved in the reference Workspace (**mind that pipeline can be also created from *templates*** – click on “*Choose a task to start*”). 
For each pipeline, we have a bottom pane with:
-	*Parameters*: to manage parameters (e.g., in Notebooks).
-	*Variables*: to manage variables.
-	*Settings*: general pipeline settings.
-	*Output*: to check the activity output if it is failed/successful.

If a pipeline activity is selected, the bottom pane will show the main properties and info connected to the selected activity, distributed in:
-	*General*: general activity properties.
-	*Source*: data source properties.
-	*Destination*: target properties.
-	*Mapping*: possible features mapping.
-	*Settings*: general settings.
