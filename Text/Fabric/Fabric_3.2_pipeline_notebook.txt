### 3.2 Pipeline to Notebook

It is possible to **add a Notebook** in a pipeline as an *activity*. 
In a Notebook, it is possible to create different **parameters** (by simply defining them, for example, as *table = “name_table”* - or even empty), and then modifying the cell by clicking on the three dots and “***Toggle Parameter Cell***”).
The rest of the code will apply transformations to the source data and possibly save the result into a Delta table (in the *Tables* folder of the Lakehouse).

Once the notebook is ready and saved, it is possible to add it in the pipeline as an activity, by selecting the appropriate button on the top menu. 
After that, it is possible to:
-	Define a name for the activity.
-	Select the appropriate notebook (if existing).

If a parameter has been created inside the notebook, in Data Factory it is crucial to create a ***Variable*** (from the top menu, go to “*Set variable*”) and then define its value or logic (e.g., a *concat* or something else). 
After that, the variable can be used as a parameter of the Notebook, specifying:
-	Name (the same one as defined in the notebook).
-	Type of data.
-	Value (that will overwrite the one defined in the Notebook).

When the pipeline is ready, then it is possible to *validate* it, *run* it, and/or *schedule* it.
