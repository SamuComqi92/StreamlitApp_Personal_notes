### Semantic model

**Qlik overview**

In Qlik, we have the so-called ***associative model***:
  - Everything is connected and everything responds to any interactions.
  - At load time, the Qlik Associative Engine combines data sources, achieving a *many-to-many* full outer join without data loss or inaccuracy, creating a compressed, in-memory data store with indexed relationships.
  - In this context, high-cardinality columns are treated efficiently and the performance is high. 
	- Qlik gives the possibility to see what values are filtered, what *can* be filtered, and what *cannot*.
	- Moreover, each filter application is propagated in all pages of a report.

In other words, the *associative model* can be considered like a semantic model with *many-to-many bi-directional relationships* set between tables.

.

**Comparison with Power BI**

In Power BI, the semantic model implementation has great importance:
- In general, a **star-schema** is preferred but solutions like *snowflake-schema* and *flat table* may have comparable performances in some cases.
- In Power BI, it is possible to set the *direction* of a relationship (i.e. single or bi-directional).
	- Single relationships ensure that filters are propagated in specific directions (i.e. from dimension tables to fact tables).
	- Bi-directional relationships can mimic the Qlik associative model *but* such an implementation can raise severe performance issues.

In general:

> Many-to-many and bi-directional relationships are discouraged to prevent data inconsistencies and performance issues.

Another Power BI issue that can lead to poor performance is represented by **high cardinality columns**: 
- Power BI is less efficient than Qlik in handling them because of the less data compression.

> A Power BI semantic model with many-to-many and bi-directional relationships (with high-cardinality key-columns) can mimic the Qlik associative model *but* it can have severe performance issues, especially when dealing with a larger number of records.

.

**Filters**

To mimic the Qlik associative model, *filters must be synchronized on all pages in a Power BI report*. This can be achieved by:
- *High-customizable solution*: create the same slicers on all pages (and possibly manage their visibility)
- *Low-customizable solution*: Add relevant fields in the *Filter Pane*, in the "Filter on all pages" section.

A hybrid solution is discouraged because the *Filter pane* filters interact with the canvas filters, but the vice-versa is not valid.
