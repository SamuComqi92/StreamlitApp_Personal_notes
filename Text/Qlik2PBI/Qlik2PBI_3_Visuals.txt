### Visualizations & Report Layout

Both Qlik and Power BI has native visuals to represent each data scenario.

- **Qlik**
	- It is possible to create visuals using HTML scripts, showing values from measures and custom expressions.
	- It is possible to use extentions, both visuals and UI elements to enhance User Experience.
		- For example, it is possible to use extentions with animations (e.g. rotating cards based on conditions, expandable navigation menu on mouse-hover).
	
- **Power BI**
	- It is possible to use native visuals or *custom visuals* from the AppSource (not all visuals are free!)
	- Some Qlik visuals cannot be replicated into Power BI without some workaround.
	- To fill the gap (almost completely), the custom visual [Deneb](https://deneb-viz.github.io/) can be the best solutions to replicated/create any chart using Vega/Vega-Lite scripts.

**Report layout and page rendering**

Qlik handles *heavy pages* very well:
- Many visuals can be created on the same page without severe performance and/or rendering issues.
- In Power BI, one of the best-practise is **to create small pages with a limited number of visuals** in order to have the best performance.
	- Heavy pages, especially when visuals have complex measures based on a large number of records, can have severe performance and rendering issues.
