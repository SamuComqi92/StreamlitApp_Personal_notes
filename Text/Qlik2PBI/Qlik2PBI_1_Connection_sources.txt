### Connections and sources

Both tools can connect to a large number of sources using the native connectors. However:

- It is possible to connect **Qlik** to the so-called ***qvd files***:
  - These are data exported from Qlik Sense or Qlik View, vastly optimized for reading
  - Reading those files is way better than reading data from the original sources.
  - Those files enable users to develop highly performant ETL processes, even with very complex transformations
  - In this sense, Qlik power is unmatched:
    - High data compression
    - Operations like *join*, data trasnformations, etc. are easily done, even with hundreds of millions of rows and high cardinality columns.
- In this context, **Power BI** has limited capabilities and less power BI than Qlik.
  - The same operations done in Qlik can be replicated in Power BI **but** they will be less performant (even impossible to do) especially when dealing with hundreds of millions of rows and high cardinality columns. 
    - This is why one of the *best-practices* is to push those operations to the back-end and leave the original DB handle them.
		- In these extreme cases, *Query-folding* is not applied on merge operations complex data tranformations: *Power Query* is not powerful enough (list of operations that are folded ---> [external link](https://itsnotaboutthecell.com/2023/01/27/the-almost-definitive-guide-to-query-folding/).
